# Mean_Stack_Todo_List
Just started exploring mean stack by creating a todo app.

To run it:
1) Run node server (OSX) in a terminal: npm start
2) For mongo, navigate to bin directory within mongo directory.
3) Execute below commands (OSX) in terminal tabs or in new terminal.
i> ./mongod (starts mongo server)
ii> ./mongo (connects to database, can be queried to see data)
